# MediaPlayer
A simple media player for macOS and Windows, based on Python 3, PyQt5 (portable to PyQt6 or PySide6) and a custom video widget that uses native system multimedia frameworks directly ([AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/) in macOS, DirectShow and [LAV Filters](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters) in Windows).
